# Word Search
This is my word search puzzle creator

This is a work in progress, when it is finished it should have the following features:
* A customizable, dynamically created word search puzzle
* Configuration options will include number of words and available word directions to insert into the puzzle
* Local storage for saving progress on your puzzle so you can come back later
* Preferences saved when creating a new puzzle (number of words, valid directions)

## To get running

* npm install

* gulp

This will process html, scss, and js files from the src directory into build directory.

Run local server or deploy from build directory to launch app.
